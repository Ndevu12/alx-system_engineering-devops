# What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" and Press Enter?

The seemingly effortless act of navigating to a website actually involves a complex choreography of various technologies and systems working together seamlessly. Let's peel back the layers and uncover the intricate journey of a URL.

## DNS Request:

When you press Enter, Your browser sends a request to a DNS server, which then responds with the corresponding IP address for "www.google.com."

## TCP/IP:

Armed with the IP address, your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server hosting Google's website. TCP ensures that data packets are reliably transmitted between your computer and the server over the Internet Protocol (IP).

## Firewall:

Before your request reaches Google's servers, it may encounter a firewallâ€”a security measure designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. The firewall ensures that only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through, protecting against malicious attacks and unauthorized access.

## HTTPS/SSL:

Now comes the crucial step of establishing a secure connection. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the server, safeguarding it from eavesdroppers and hackers. This encryption is made possible by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), which authenticate the server's identity and encrypt the data transmitted over the connection.

## Load-Balancer:

Google employs load balancers. These intelligent devices distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, optimizing resource utilization and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

## Web Server:

The web server processes the request, retrieving the necessary resources such as HTML files, images, and scripts, and constructs a response to send back to your browser.

## Application Server:

Dynamic content generated in real-time. This is where application servers come into play. These servers execute code written in languages like Python, Java, or PHP, interacting with databases and other resources to generate personalized content based on user requests.

## Database:

Vast array of services relies on databases to store and retrieve data efficiently. Whether it's indexing billions of web pages, serving up search results, or personalizing ads, databases play a crucial role. These databases store and manage vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, ensuring rapid access and reliability.

The journey of a URL from your browser to a website like "https://www.google.com" is a fascinating voyage through the intricacies of modern internet infrastructure. Each step, from DNS lookup to database retrieval, involves a complex interplay of technologies and systems working together to deliver the seamless browsing experience we often take for granted.
